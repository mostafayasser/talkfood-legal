# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 30/12/2025

TalkFood ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the TalkFood mobile application.

TalkFood allows users to log food intake using voice input. When you speak into the app, your voice is converted into text using your device's built-in speech recognition functionality. TalkFood does not store, record, or retain voice audio.

The transcribed text may be processed using third-party AI services, including the Gemini API, solely for the purpose of identifying food items and estimating nutritional information such as calories and protein. No personal identifiers are included in this processing.

TalkFood does not require users to create an account and does not collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or precise location data. All food logs and usage data are stored locally on the user's device.

TalkFood may offer optional in-app subscriptions. Payments are processed securely through the App Store or Google Play using RevenueCat. TalkFood does not collect or store payment information.

TalkFood is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If new features require additional data handling, this policy will be updated accordingly.
